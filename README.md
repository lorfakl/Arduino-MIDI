# Arduino MIDI Controller
 This is a MIDI Controller I am putting together in order to 
 ultimately put into a mobile DAW powered by a Raspberry Pi
 This Controller was designed to work with an Arduino board with custom 
 USB microcontroller firmware HIDuino: https://github.com/ddiakopoulos/hiduino
 A tutorial on how to install this custom firmware is located here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmFtMAZOGZo&t=10s
 For Debugging purposes there are calls to the Serial in this code, 
 however be sure to remove those when this sketch is 
 Uploaded onto a board with HIDuino
